# 📊 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project predicts whether a person has diabetes or not using *Machine Learning models* trained on healthcare data.  
It aims to showcase how *AI/ML can assist in healthcare decision-making* by analyzing important health parameters.

## 🚀 Features  
- Data Preprocessing & Cleaning (handling missing values)  
- Data Visualization using *Matplotlib & Seaborn*  
- Implementation of *Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM*  
- Model Evaluation using *Accuracy Score & Confusion Matrix*  
- Comparison of models to choose the best performing one  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- *Programming Language:* Python 🐍  
- *Libraries Used:*  
  - Pandas  
  - NumPy  
  - Scikit-Learn  
  - Matplotlib  
  - Seaborn

## 📂 Dataset  
The project uses the *Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset*, which includes features like:  
- Glucose  
- Blood Pressure  
- Skin Thickness  
- Insulin  
- BMI  
- Diabetes Pedigree Function  
- Age  
- Outcome (0 = Non-Diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)
